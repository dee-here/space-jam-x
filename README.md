# Why Did we create space Jam X?
We wanted to create a dynamic website that would be visually appealing to the user, while also allowing them to do research on past historical and current space events and occurrences. 
This application is designed to highlight and exhibit celestial events and phenomena.

This feature lets users find Celestial objects nearing earth for the selected day. The date picker allows users to select dates from past and future. Data returned from the Nasa NEO api is formatted to display each object as a card. Details include name, speed, approach date and size.
